description: |

## Purpose
ULTRA-COMPREHENSIVE PRP for building a production-ready Universal Consultant Intelligence Platform with complete code implementations, advanced patterns, and detailed architecture for AI-powered prospect research, dynamic consultant templates, wizard-based setup, and automated outreach capabilities.

## Core Principles
1. **Complete Implementation Code**: Full working implementations, not pseudocode
2. **Production-Ready Architecture**: Advanced async patterns, comprehensive error handling
3. **Extensive Documentation**: Every component fully documented with examples
4. **Validation Loops**: Docker-based testing with executable validation at each stage
5. **Global Rules**: Strict adherence to CLAUDE.md specifications

### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks
```python
# CRITICAL: FastAPI requires async functions for database operations
# See research/fastapi/08-async-programming.md for patterns
async def get_prospect(db: AsyncSession, prospect_id: int) -> Prospect:
    result = await db.execute(select(Prospect).where(Prospect.id == prospect_id))
    return result.scalar_one_or_none()

# CRITICAL: OpenAI rate limits require exponential backoff
# See research/openai/03-rate-limits.md for implementation
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10))

# CRITICAL: Pandas StringDtype required for text processing
# See research/pandas/03-text-processing.md for proper usage
