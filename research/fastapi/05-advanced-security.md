# FastAPI Advanced Security

## Key Observations:
- This is an advanced section of the FastAPI documentation focusing on security features
- It builds upon the basic security tutorial covered earlier in the documentation
- The page suggests there are additional security features beyond the basic tutorial

## Important Guidance:
- The documentation recommends reading the main Security Tutorial first before exploring these advanced sections
- The advanced security features are not necessarily complex, but offer extra functionality for different use cases

## Upcoming Topics (as indicated in the navigation):
- OAuth2 scopes
- HTTP Basic Authentication

## Key Principles:
- These are supplementary security techniques that can be applied depending on specific application requirements
- The goal is to provide developers with flexible security implementation options
- Focus on practical, implementable security patterns

The content suggests diving deeper into authentication and authorization mechanisms specific to FastAPI, with emphasis on real-world applications.
